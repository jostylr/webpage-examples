License: Since I am using a lot of other people's tutorials, I have no idea about the right to reuse. I won't object though. 

## TODO

Floating labels: http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/ux-tutorials/implementing-the-float-label-form-pattern/

Explore Bootswatch: http://bootswatch.com/

Run through this tutorial:  http://www.sitepoint.com/understanding-twitter-bootstrap-3/

Knockout:  http://knockoutjs.com/   A spreadsheet grid would be good. Maybe explore http://minifiedjs.com/  as well.


## gitignore

We should ignore node_modules (particularly the dev ones) and ghpages which is just a directory where I have the gh-pages branch repo. 

    node_modules
    ghpages
